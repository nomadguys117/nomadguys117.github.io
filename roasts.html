They have at least 4 meeting a day about the same topic and need a little something stronger to keep them going in the day this is the perfect blend of your to keep you going in the day.

        Raise your coffee mug to those people that listen to people when they’re in trouble and help them stay calm in a scary situation, or there to listen to people ask for help when they get themselves into stupid situations. Either way they need stronger coffee to keep them going in the day and not want to call the people on the other line stupid. Cheers to you.

        This is for that salty man who needs something a little bit stronger than what those young bucks need, but can’t have the hard stuff because to be honest, it’ll probably kill him.

        These guys are no strangers to dark stuff. They need something just as strong as the smoke they inhale to drink to wake them up. These guys are tough as nails.

      <p>
        This guy is the saltiest one at the precinct. His mug has dark coffee rings on the inside and theres always no coffee in the pot. And when there is he makes the coffee without a filter. This guy drinks it raw.
